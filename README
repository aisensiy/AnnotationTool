This is an application to annotate corpus. The input is a
format like:
		1-1 xxx
		1-2 xxx
		2-1 xxxx
The number before '-' is the id of an entry and the number
after '-' is a number which represents a attribute of the
entry. Right now, the app can only read file format like
this.
The app is written in Python and I create the gui with
Tkinter.
